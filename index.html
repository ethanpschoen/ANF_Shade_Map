    <h2>About the Map</h2>
    <p>Residents of Los Angeles are fortunate to have access to dozens of trails, some just minutes from their front doors. These trails range from trails that are manageable for beginners as well as challenging trails for seasoned hikers. But even for hikers who feel comfortable tackling trails with big elevation gains and long distances, one of the most difficult aspects of hiking in Los Angeles county is the brutal sun and heat which can lead to heat exhaustion and dehydration, potentially dangerous and life-threatening situations when help is not nearby. The shade data allows you to plan your hikes and outdoor activities with detailed information to ensure a safe and fun visit to the Angeles National Forest.</p>
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>This interactive shade tracking map of the Angeles National Forest aims to serve as a resource for hikers to better plan their hikes in safe conditions. This map visualizes the shaded areas within the Angeles National Forest, providing insights into sun exposure at different times of the day. Once you set the date of your hike, you can move the time slide to see when and where you will have shade on your hike.</p>
